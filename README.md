# Advent of Code 2024

This year I'm trying out zig for advent of code. I always find it's a nice way to try and get some practical use of a new language. Please excuse any poor zig practice as I get used to it!

To get the solutions for a day just use `zig build-exe` e.g.:
```bash
zig build-exe day1.zig
./day1 inputs/day1.txt
```
